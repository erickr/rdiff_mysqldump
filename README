Works as a wrapper around mysqldump, all options to the script are passed to mysqldump.

Some settings are included in the script, like backup working directory and the number of patchfiles between full versions.

This is still an early attempt, to play safe the script creates X number of patchfiles between full versions. As a worst case you can then use the last full version.


Usage:
rdiff_mysqldump <mysqldump options>

To restore
Find the version you like to restore, for example:
patch_20111010_202412_to_full_20111010_202238.rdiff
That patch is created 2011-10-10 20:24:12 against full backup
full_20111010_202238.sql.
$ rdiff patch full_20111010_202238.sql patch_20111010_202412_to_full_20111010_202238.rdiff REASSEMBLED_VERSION.sql

It will keep two .dot-files in the working directory:
.rdiff_mysqldump_lastbase: Filename of the last full dump.
.rdiff_patches_since_full: Number of patches generated against the last full dump.


TODO:
 - gzip last full dump when a new is done
 - better error handling of lost .dot-files
